# Genomics_MachineLearning
Predicting tolerance to stressors based on DNA sequences in Arabidopsis
# Hypotheses
1.We can predict the phenotypic traits related to stresses in Arabidopsis based on transcriptomics, genomics, and/or proteomics.
2.We can predict if a specific plant is tolearant to stressors based on its genotype.

# Description
This repository contains 2 jupyter notebooks (python). The first one is basically data wrangling of several datasets inorder to prepare the final dataset (DNA.csv). The 2nd notebook is machine learning to find the best model for prediction.
Stressors are  ABA, Over drought, Osmotic stress, JA, Et, and water deprivation.

# Sources of datasets
The datasets were gathered from the following links;
